        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Harry's Burger's opened in Catchup, Idaho in the summer of '69. Originally planned as a community event, in just one weekend, Harry's quickly established itself as one of the most popular burger joints in all of <a href="http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/did_idaho_get_its_name_as_a_result_of_a_hoax">Idaho</a>! From then on Harry decided to convert his hamburger stand into a full fledged restaurant.</p>
        <p>In 1971, with the finishing touches of the outside canopy, the restaurant was completed and opened for full service. The following year saw Harry Thomas visiting Irvine, CA to trade business secrets with <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PVLwhCRIjXoC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&source=bl&ots=jrc9vqTsjk&sig=9SE6o7GDNjazYbVUnMGTn-S2-zs&hl=en&ei=CCO0Tpa7DOS02AWv-tHMDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CFMQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&f=false">In-N-Out</a> founders Harry and Esther Snyder. The trio became best friends soon afterwards. The burgers and fries of both restaurants may not taste the same, but those with delicate tongues state they notice the taste similarities in the "special sauce."</p>
        <p>After a fire broke out in 1988 Harry was forced to move his restaurant from Catchup to the neigbhoring town of Ketchum. The restaurant is now located directly next to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s final resting place. This is why you often see guests eating a hamburger while reading a book in the outside seating area. We have a saying around here: <i>"At Harry's Burger's &mdash; The Sun Also Rises".</i></p>
